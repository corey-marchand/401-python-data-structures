# Reverse an Array
Code challenge #2- Array Shift

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index. 

## Approach & Efficiency
Create a function that will take an array and a value, and insert the value into the middle of the array.  For an effective solution, I wanted to stay away from for loops.  So i split the array in half, appended the value that is passed from the parameters to the first half of the array.  After that, I append the second half to the first half array.
